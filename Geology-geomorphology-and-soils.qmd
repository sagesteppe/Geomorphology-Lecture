# I. Geology 

- Igenous 
- Sedimentary  
- Metamorphic  

## Igneous 

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
  
- Magma (beneath earths surface - 'intrusive') & Lava (on the surface - 'extrusive') cool to form igneous rock 
- creates two of the crusts most abundant minerals: feldspar & quartz, and mica 
- feldspar & quartz are very resistant to weathering under typical conditions
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r igneous, out.width = "85%", fig.cap= "Granitoids - Gold Butte", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Igneous/Granitoids_GoldButte.png")
```
:::

## Intrusive (Igneous) 

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- formed from the continual cooling of magma
- often forming enormous masses which are able to be pushed up through the earths crust (batholiths)
- Examples: Granite, Diorite, Gabbro
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r intrusive igneous, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}
p1 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/Intrusive/granite.jpg") 
p2 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/Intrusive/diorite.jpg") 
p3 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/Intrusive/Gabbro-Mindat.png")

cowplot::plot_grid(
  p1, p2, p3, NULL,
  labels = c('Granite', 'Diorite', 'Gabbro'), ncol = 2
)
```

:::

## Extrusive (Igneous)

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- formed from lava flows
- shape and size of crystals largely defined by rate of cooling
- Two main forms; pillow (lava flowed into water), columnar (cooled in depression) 
- Examples: Basalt, Rhyolite, Andesite
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r extrusive igneous, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}
p1 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/extrusive/basalt.jpg") 
p2 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/extrusive/scott_resources_rhyolite.jpg") 
p3 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/extrusive/andesite.jpg")

## Weathering - Breakdown of bedrock

Agents: Freeze-Thaw, Water, Glaciers, Plants (lichens, mosses), Wind

<center>

</center>


## Erosion - Particle movement

- River (fluvial) - in river channel
- Water (alluvial) - ephemeral flows, flooding, stream jumping channel  
- Wind (aeolian) - pick up and drop off sediment elsewhere
- Gravity (colluvial) - large rocks e.g. boulders fall downhill

<center>
![Erosion](./images/assorted/EncylopediaBritannicaEROSION.png){width=70%}
</center>


## Sedimentary

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
Formed via the compaction of other material  
Often from sand derived from igneous materials  
Carbonates from animal shells  
Mud or silt from rivers, oceans.   
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}

![Sedimentary - St. George](./images/Sedimentary/Sedimentary-StGeorge.jpg){width=75%}
</center>
:::

## Inorganic (Sedimentary)

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- Shale - formed in oceans and large lakes from compression of silt and clay
- Sandstone - Formed from the compression of sand. 
- The original sand generally coming from massive dune fields (terrestrial sandstone), sometimes coming from oceans/beaches 
- Examples: Shale, Sandstone, Siltstone
:::

```
:::

## Organic (Sedimentary)

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Formed from compression of animals shells, coral reefs, lagoons
- Examples: Limestone, Gypsum, Dolomite  
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r organic sedimentary, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}

  labels = c('Limestone', 'Gypsum', 'Dolomite'), ncol = 2
)
```
:::

## Conglomerates

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- Formed when fine particles, e.g. clay, hold together gravels, oftentimes these are also partially cemented by calcium carbonates. 
- These generally formed in association with fluvial deposits, alluvial fans, or with glaciers.
- Examples: Breccia (angular rock fragments), Conglomerate (rounded rock fragments)
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r conglomerates, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}

  p1, p2, p3, NULL,
  labels = c('Partially lithified gravel', 'Breccia (XanaG)', 'Conglomerate'), ncol = 2
)
```
:::

## sedimentary -or- igenous extrusive?

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Ash from a volcano which lands in the same area, and is compressed to create a soft rock - *tuff*. 
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r sedimentary, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}
p1 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Igneous/extrusive/leslie_gulch.jpg")

cowplot::plot_grid(
  p1, p2,
  labels = c('Leslie Gulch', 'Welded Tuff'), ncol = 1
)
```
:::

## Metamorphic 

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Rocks which are transformed via heat, and oftentimes pressure, into new rocks. 
- Oftentimes associated with the uplift and building of mountain ranges (orogeny)
- *protolith* is the original un-transformed rock type
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
<center>
![Metamorphic - Pioneer Mountains](./images/Metamorphic/PioneerMtns.jpg){width=75%}
</center>
:::

## Foliated

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- Formed by both heat and extreme pressure compress the protolith in layers results in a layered appearance
- Examples: Slate (protolith - shale), Schist (protoliths - many, e.g. mudstone, tuffs), Gneiss (protoliths - many, higher temps than schist)
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r Foliated, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}
p1 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Metamorphic/Foliated/slate.jpg")

cowplot::plot_grid(
  p1, p2, p3, NULL,
  labels = c('Slate', 'Chlorite Schist', 'Gneiss'), ncol = 2
)
```
:::

## Non-foliated

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Formed by heating the protolith, without pressure
- rocks lack defined layering
- Examples: Marble (limestone), Quartzite (Sandstone)
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
```{r Non foliated, out.width= "500px", echo=FALSE}
p1 <- cowplot::ggdraw() + cowplot::draw_image("./images/Metamorphic/Non-foliated/Marble-geology.com.jpg")

## Classification of Bedrock - Members, Formations & Groups

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- Over the several millenia it takes to produce substantial amounts of Earths Crust, several processes repeatedly occur which result in a consistent mix of bedrocks.   
- *Member* a similar set of layers  
- *Formations* are composed of members which commonly occur together  
- *Groups* composed of formations which commonly co-occur.

</center>
:::

## Member

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

- Members are visually distinctive groups of layers (i.e. individual and consecutive mudstone and siltstone layers which look similar may form a member). 
- Oftentimes from many cm to meters thin; not always delineated by geologists

## Formation

- 'Thick' enough to be mapped; distinctive enough to be readily recognizable
- Named after a geographic location which contains the formation (e.g. Entrada Point for Entrada Sandstone)
- often contains *many* members, not all of which are present throughout it's entire range.
- composed of members which commonly occur together (e.g. Morrison Formation; mostly mudstones/silstone/limestone with intermittent aeolian sandstones, the former deposited sequentially in deltas or in coastal areas)

## Mountains - Glacial Features

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
**Cirque**  a lake carved out by a glacier.   
**Arete** sharp ridges initially created by glacial action on both sides, and subsequent sloughing of rock typically via freeze-thaw cycles.
![Alpine Landforms](./images/landforms/alpine_landforms_wikipedia_NPS.png){width=100s%}
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
<font size= '5'>
**Col** lowest point on a mountain ridge, occasionally formed via two glaciers    
**Hanging Valley** a, generally smaller valley, above a larger one, often separated by a cliff. Created by a smaller glacier.   
**Horn** A sharp peak which has been eroded by cirques and freeze-thaw cycles on one to multiple sides.    
**Tarn** Body of water formed in a depression created by glacier and often bounded downhill by a moraine (debris dropped by a glacier) 
</font>
:::

## Mesa

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
Origins   
1) a block is uplifted by tectonic activity.   
2) A much softer rock (oftentimes shale) erodes quickly,   
3) until an underlying harder rock, deposited horizontally, is exposed (capstone; often sandstone).   

:::

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
**Positions** *right* (nearly vertical sides), *summit* (flat top)  
A butte is a small mesa, a plateau or tableland is a large mesa!  

<center>
![Mancos Shale](./images/assorted/Mancos_Shale_badlands_in_Capitol_Reef_NP.jpg){width=95%}
</center>
:::

## Cuesta

**Positions** *Dipslope* (gently slope), *escarpment* (steep slope)   
**Origins** a softer bedrock is eroded away leaving behind the surface associated with a harder layer.   
Similar to a mesa, but on it's side.

## Alluvial Fans & Bajadas

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}

**Positions** *apex* (where the constricted channel opens out), *braided streams* (the channels carved out by water), *apron*  (the cone shaped section)    

**Origins** soil, and rock fragments (alluvium), are washed out and deposited from mountains and hills via streams. 

**Bajadas** an area where individual alluvial fans meet
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
<center>
![Death Valley](./images/landforms/DeathValleyWash.jpg){width=65%}
</center>
:::

## Pediment

essentially bedrock with a thin layer of gravel and soil at the base of an eroding mountain; often found above a bajada   
<br>
*Origins* these areas are erosion, i.e. they are losing soil, often by sheet erosion (a uniform wall of water)   

## Terraces 
*Positions* **tread** horizontal step like portion. **riser** vertical step like portion   
Origins  
  - Fluvial/Lacustrine/Marine terraces; as the level of water varies it eats away portions of the bedrock  
  - Structural Terraces (or Bench); develop in 'flat' areas, different layers of bedrock weather at different rates

## Flats 1/2

::: {style="float: left; width: 40%;"}

*Valleys* surrounded by mountains/hills on two sides (and likely to contain a terrace(s)).  

*Plains* areas largely surrounded by mountains/hills on all sides.  

*Playas* an (historically/currently) vernal lake in an endorheic basin
:::

![Playa](./images/landforms/AlvordDesertPlayaBLM.jpg){width=85%}
</center>
:::

## Flats 2/2

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
Origins:   
*Valleys* Fluvial action eroding mountains, and the distribution of sediment throughout; Glacial action; areas where two tectonic plates are moving apart and causing 'rifts', the ground to sink.     
*Plains* Depositional where sediment is deposited from rivers or glaciers or lakes; Erosional, where forces have essentially leveled all bedrock and features.   
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 40%;"}
*Playas* associated with valleys which lack a low point for streams to escape from. Upslope stream water, which has accumulated soil minerals, runs into the low point of the valley, and eventually evaporates, leaving behind the minerals.  
<center>
![Playa](./images/landforms/AlvordDesertPlayaBLM.jpg){width=100%}
</center>
::: 

## Dunes 

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Aeolian Dunes & General  
  - *Windward* side exposed to the predominant wind **windward**   
  - *slip face* the side downwind of the windward side; generally gentler than the windward side.   
  - *dune slack* flat-ish areas between individuals dunes.   
- Marine Dunes  
  - *foredune* the first ridge of dunes running parallel to the water)   
  - *backdunes* all dunes inland from foredunes   
  - *dune hollow* areas of dune slack essentially at water level

</center>
:::

## Slope Shape  

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- The slopes of hills and other features affect the distribution of water, nutrients, and rocks.   
- Both down (profile), and across (plan) slope.  
- Three main shapes: Linear, Concave, Convex.   
- Convex areas are less likely to build up considerable soil, and maintain water relative to linear and concave slopes.  
- parlance: profile-plan e.g. 4 is convex-linear, 5 is concave-linear ('straight' is a European term)

## Textural Components  

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- **Sand** generally broken feldspar and quartz minerals; largest size component   
- **Clay** small molecules, composed of phyllosilicates, absorb and shed water; smallest size component   
- **Silt** intermediate sized particles, largely of more broken quartz; intermediate size component

## Soil texture varies across geomorphons

Sand,  
1) often picked up from mountains (esp. volcanic) and blown similar distances to create massive depositional areas (dune fields)  
2) often picked up by rivers, but dropped when water slows down (fluvial... )  
3) where blown away can create 'desert pavement'  

Clay,  
1) able to be carried far distances by water, generally until the water becomes stagnant (lakes). Upon drying lakes become playas
2) moves throughout the soil profile as water levels change, and can accumulate around roots. 

Silt,  
1) generally falling out of suspension just upslope of clay (alluvial systems) - but inextricably linked.

## Soil Colour

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Reflects the amount of soil organic matter, mineral types, and oxidation status. 
- Colour itself does not affect soil or plant growth - purely reflects chemical parameters
- color soil when it is moderately wet, but not as wet as for a soil ribbon test

## Carbonates

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}

- Calcium carbonates, generally derived from sedimentary limestones, dissolve readily into rainwater. 
- As the rainwater evaporates the carbonates precipitate into solids 
- this generally occurs at moderate soil depths (30-50cm), following day/night cycles of plant water use. 
- In certain areas (esp. Chihuahuan desert) forming an impermeable layer - caliche

:::

## Salinity  

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}

- continual dissolution into soil moisture when wet, continual precipitation as soil dries
- Continual movement of various salts (cations), such as Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium (from mudstones!) to down slope areas
- extreme salinity build ups; cations hold onto water molecules more strongly than most plant roots can grab them

## Rock Fragments  

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Soils vary in the amount, size, and dimensions, of rock fragments. 
- Rock fragments decrease the water holding capacity of a soil. 
- If soils have > 15% rock fragments, they have a modifier, e.g. '*Very gravelly* sandy loam'

## Rock Fragments - Size

::: {style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Rock fragments are > 2mm in diameter, just larger than very coarse sand  
  - Gravel (2-75 mm)  
  - Cobbles (75-250 mm)  
  - Stones (250-600 mm)
  - Boulders (600+ mm) 
  
:::

::: {style="float: right; width: 50%;"}
- measure rocks along the longest axis
- Very flat (essentially laterally compressed) rocks: 
  - channers (2mm-15cm)
  - flagstones (15-38cm)
  - 'flat stone' (>38cm)

## Rock Fragments - Texture Modifiers

- When describing soils, if the soil is more than 15% rock fragments, a texture modifier is used, e.g. '*Very gravelly* sandy loam'  
- Texture modifiers are quickly calculated by working across the first two columns, from left to right (Table 1), and making the final comparison).

## Rock Fragments - Texture Modifiers - Examples

- Texture modifiers are quickly calculated by working across the first two columns, from left to right (Table 1), and making the final comparison). 
- Examples at right show the calculations in the final column.

## Soil Horizons - Master Layers

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- distinguishable to humans via sight and touch   
- up to 5 master layers
  - **A** Surface Soil. The most organic matter and microbial activity. Clay minerals and oxides form here. 
  - **E** Mineral horizon. Has lost Fe, Al, Mn oxides, clay minerals; organic matter via illuviation.
  - **B** Subsoil, less microbial activity The clay and oxides, which tend to color this layer, percolate down via illuviation.

  - **C** Substratum. At most, partially weathered rocks. Often accumulates mobile minerals like CaCO~3~

## Soil Horizons - Suffixes

::: {style="float: left; width: 60%;"}
- Express modifications to a horizon, each horizon may have several. Some examples.    
  - **t** accumulation of clay from an upper horizon   
  - **k** accumulation of carbonates   
  - **m** cementation of soil via a mineral agent (e.g. **k**)   
- Some are restricted to certain horizons
- Some are modifiers, e.g. **m**.
- Horizons can be subdivided into different suffixes, e.g. bk'1 and bk'2

## In Closing... 

this is a totally distinct branch of natural history, we really ask little of you. Just get out there and give it a try.
